Severity: Critical
Synopsis: The remote Windows Domain Controller is vulnerable to an elevation of privilege vulnerability in Netlogon.
What was the core mechanism of the ZeroLogon exploit?
A. It exploited a flaw in the Netlogon Remote Protocol's AES-CFB8 encryption for session keys, allowing an attacker to set an empty password for the Domain Controller's machine account by sending specially crafted Netlogon messages.

[INFO] skipping static GET parameter 'id'
[INFO] testing dynamic POST parameter 'name'
[INFO] testing dynamic POST parameter 'value'
You use `**` to mark injection points in `--data`. What does `--skip-static` attempt to do?
A. It tells SQLMap to only test parameters that it heuristically determines to be dynamic (i.e., their values change between requests), and skip testing parameters that appear static. This is not what `--skip-static` does based on typical SQLMap usage.
B. It skips testing parameters that do not have the `**` marker.
C. It skips all GET parameters and only tests POST parameters.
D. This is not a standard SQLMap option. It should be `--skip` or based on heuristics.
*(Self-correction: `--skip-static` is not a standard SQLMap option. The user might be thinking of how SQLMap heuristically determines dynamic parameters, or the `--skip` option. Rephrasing to be about a valid related concept or ignoring a non-dynamic parameter)*
**Rephrased for valid concept (or common confusion):**
If SQLMap's output mentioned it was "skipping non-dynamic GET parameter 'paramX'", what would this generally imply?
A. SQLMap heuristically determined that 'paramX' always has the same value and is unlikely to be an injection point, so it skips extensive testing on it to save time unless forced.
B. 'paramX' is known to be protected by a WAF.
C. 'paramX' was explicitly excluded using the `--skip` option.
D. 'paramX' is an unknown parameter type to SQLMap.

A. To attempt to dump credentials (like NTLM hashes or Kerberos tickets) directly from LSASS memory, and because LSASS is a stable system process.
B. To make the Meterpreter session run faster.
C. To hide the Meterpreter session from the Task Manager (this is not guaranteed).
D. To gain SYSTEM privileges (migration itself doesn't grant new privs, but LSASS runs as SYSTEM).

250. Tool: Burp Suite
Output:
In Burp Intruder, you have set payload positions for `username` and `password`.
You have one payload list for `username` containing 10 usernames.
You have another payload list for `password` containing 100 passwords.
You select the "Battering Ram" attack type. How many requests will be made?
A. 1000 (10 usernames * 100 passwords, trying each username with each password in the list for that position iteratively for each request which has only one payload marker). This is not how Battering Ram works.
B. 110 (10 + 100). This is also incorrect.
C. Battering Ram uses a single payload set. It iterates through that set, placing the same payload value into all defined payload positions for each request. If you have two lists, it's not the right attack type for independent iteration, or the question is ill-posed for Battering Ram.
D. Battering Ram takes one list of payloads. For each payload in that single list, it places that payload into *all* defined positions for that request. If you have two separate lists configured, it is not directly using them in a combined way for Battering Ram. The question likely implies a misunderstanding of Battering Ram or a misconfiguration if two separate lists are "assigned" to it this way. Assuming the user intends to use *one* list for all positions: if the first list of 10 usernames was the one used for the Battering Ram, it would make 10 requests, putting username_X in both username and password fields. This needs clarification.
**Correction for better MCQ**: Assuming Intruder was somehow set to use one list (e.g., the usernames list) and applied it to both positions, it would make 10 requests. If the question implies a *single combined list* was used, then it would be the size of that list. Let's assume the intent was to test a single list against both positions.
**Rephrasing for clarity based on Battering Ram's typical use:**
You select "Battering Ram". You have one payload list containing 20 common credentials (e.g., "admin", "password", "test"). You have marked *both* the username and password fields as payload positions. How many requests?
A. 20 (It uses each payload from the single list and puts it into all marked positions for that request)
B. 400 (20*20)
C. 2 (one for username, one for password)
D. 40 (20+20)

*(Self-correction: The original question was confusing for Battering Ram. I've rephrased it to be clear for option A to be correct. I'll use this rephrased version).*

497. Tool: OWASP ZAP
Output:
Alert: Private IP Address Disclosure
Risk: Low
Evidence: Response body contains "Server internal_ip is 10.0.0.5"
Why is this considered a finding?
A. It reveals internal network architecture, which could be useful to an attacker who gains internal access or for SSRF.
B. It means the server is directly accessible via its private IP from the internet.
C. This is a false positive.
D. It allows for immediate RCE.

498. Tool: Burp Suite
Output:
The application uses a custom encryption scheme in a cookie value: `data=AbCdEf12345sOMErANDOMdATA`.
Modifying any part of the encrypted value results in an error or invalid session.
What is this a common indication of?
A. The encrypted data likely includes a Message Authentication Code (MAC) or an authenticated encryption mode (like AES-GCM) is used.
B. The encryption is weak and easily reversible.
C. No encryption is actually used, it's just encoding.
D. The data is not important for session state.
